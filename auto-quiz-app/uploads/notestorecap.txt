Workflow:
* Uploading Document:
   * Upload → processed via API → OpenAI API formats data → stored locally.
   * Valid files trigger quiz area display, invalid files return to homepage with a modal.
* Quiz Display & Unanswered Questions:
   * Topics and subtopics organized in a sidebar.
   * Sidebar tracks progress (turns green for completed topics).
   * Unanswered questions remain gray; users are prompted via modal.
* Viewing Results & Retake:
   * Users can view results, retake the quiz, or start a new one.
   * Sidebar hides on smaller screens for better user experience.
Highlights:
* OpenAI Integration:
   * Used OpenAI API to format quiz content based on user input.
* Navigation (router.push vs. Link):
   * router.push for programmatic navigation with dynamic logic.
   * Link for static, user-initiated navigation.
* Next.js Components:
   * Server components render on the server, client components on both server and client.
   * Solution: Server components as children of client components for performance optimization.
