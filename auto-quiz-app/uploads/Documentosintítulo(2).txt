Cell Structure and Function
* Cell Theory: All living organisms are composed of cells. Cells are the basic unit of life and all cells come from pre-existing cells.
* Types of Cells:
   * Prokaryotic Cells: Do not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. Example: Bacteria.
   * Eukaryotic Cells: Have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Example: Animal and plant cells.
* Cell Organelles:
   * Nucleus: Contains genetic material (DNA).
   * Mitochondria: Powerhouse of the cell; site of ATP production.
   * Ribosomes: Site of protein synthesis.
   * Endoplasmic Reticulum: Smooth ER (lipid synthesis) and Rough ER (protein synthesis).
   * Golgi Apparatus: Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids.
   * Lysosomes: Contain digestive enzymes to break down waste.
Genetics
* DNA Structure: Double helix composed of nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine).
* Gene Expression: The process by which information from a gene is used to synthesize a protein.
* Mendelian Genetics: Study of inheritance patterns discovered by Gregor Mendel, including dominant and recessive traits.
* Genetic Variation: Caused by mutations, gene flow, and sexual reproduction.
