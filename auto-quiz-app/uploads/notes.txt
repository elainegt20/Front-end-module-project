React Basics:
Components and JSX:
Components are the building blocks of React applications.
JSX is a syntax used within React to write what looks like HTML but in JavaScript.
Example: <div>Hello, {name}</div>.
State and Props:
State: Internal data managed within a component (useState for functional components).
Props: External data passed from a parent component to a child component.
React Intermediate:
Hooks:

useEffect: Manages side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.
useContext: Enables state or data sharing across components without prop drilling.
Lifecycle Methods vs. Hooks:

In class components, lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount) control component behavior over time.
Functional components rely on hooks (useEffect) to achieve the same behavior.
